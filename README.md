# Journey of the Return

## Moment To Moment Gameplay Description
The game will be a puzzle platformer. The goal of each level is to search for information about the whereabouts of robot lost somewhere in the level. The player will solve puzzles to get deeper into the level. Since much of the game will take place in a city, this will mean finding ways to open locked doors, or convince an NPC to give them information necessary to continue forward. As the player goes, they'll also gather hints about the story behind the robot they're trying to rescue along the way. Scrap metal will also be strewn about the level for the character to collect to encourage the them to explore (early on, the player will be given a secondary goal to collect 2 tons of scrap, needed to repair their ship to return home).

When the player eventually finds the robot, they'll need to convince the robot to return to where they ran away from. This will involve hooking up into the robot's mind, and fighting a boss that represents the struggle they're facing. The bosses will be more skill/action oriented to vary from the normal gameplay.

Once the robot has been rescued, the player and the robot will return to the village where the robot lives. Over time as the player rescues more robots, the appearance of the village will become more & more lively with the return of old friends and loved ones.

## Story
### Act 1: Leaving the Ninety and Nine
Jerrod, an artificial intelligence expert working as a technician on a space ship called "The Return" crash lands next to a small village on a desert planet full of robots. He escapes from the wreckage with one other survivor, and is taken to the village by a Robot named Ephraim in order to tend the other survivor's wounds.

On this planet, the robots have highly advanced biological technology parallel to our own. They genetically synthesize and modify DNA to build creatures and plants that meet their needs the way that we build computers and devices. However, in the village it's a religious taboo to create lifeforms that resemble robot-kind (aka, human-like creatures).

As Ephraim enters the village with Jerrod and the injured shipmate, Jerrod notices that the village seems deserted. Ephraim explains that the city has lured away most of his clan. When Jerrod hears that he gets excited at the possibility of getting the resources to repair the ship, Ephraim warns Jerrod to stay away, explaining that the city has a way of twisting people.

Ephraim brings the injured shipmate to his younger brother. The brother does not believe in the religious traditions of the village, and so has no qualms working on the shipmate. The shipmate dies while the brother is operating on him, and in desparation the brother re-animates the shipmate, though instead of restoring life, he ends up turning the shipmate into little more than a puppet. Ephraim gets into an argument with the brother over the results of the operation, and the brother decides to leave the village to head to the city, where the old traditions aren't taught. Ephraim and Jerrod decide to follow after Ephraim's brother through the desert to the city.

### Act 2: Lost Sheep
When Jerrod and Ephraim arrive in the city to look for the brother, they're shocked to find that the colorful allure of the city skyline gives way to a ruinous wasteland of broken down buildings and dangerous alleyways. The robots that live there have all fallen prey to idleness, addiction, or are metnally sick to one degree or another. The player notices that each of the robots has modified themselves with things like decorative perforations in their outer sheet metal, carvings, and welded-on objects & symbols, and that the robots there are convinced that it's still somehow a paradise. The creatures that are built there are all humanoid, and serve the robots like puppets.  

As the Ephraim and Jerrod search the city for Ephraim's brother, they find various members of the village who had run away for one reason or another. Each villager is hiding a regret or a mistake of their past that weighs on them. Some examples include:
- An artist who feels that their work will never be unique enough
- A murderer who's haunted by the guilt of killing his friend
- A wife who married her husband for reasons other than love
- A suicidal robot who feels they'll never measure up to basic expectations
- A robot caught up in an addiction

Jerrod helps them deal with the issues that caused them to run away in the first place. In each scenario, Jerrod will also have an opportunity to repair the robot as well. The player is given the option to either use a lot of the scrap they've collected and do a full repair, or save on scrap and do a patch job, just good enough to get the robot back home to the village. Each rescued villager gives clues as to the brother's whereabouts, taking Jerrod and Ephraim deeper and deeper into the city. And with each villager, Jerrod begins to feel his own past mistakes weighing on him. Eventually, they learn that the wayward brother has left and is making his way up a nearby mountainside.

### Act #3: Healing
Jerrod and Ephraim follow after the brother, and finally catch up to him close to the summit. By this time, the brother has undergone a complete transformation from a simple farm robot to a heavily modified monstrosity. So heavily modified in fact, that he's barely functioning. Jerrod and Ephraim learn that he's here because he discovered that all robots that live on this planet come from atop the mountain, and he's directing them away from the village and towards the city. Just as they learn this from him, he breaks down and collapses. Jerrod is able to repair his mind and get him functioning temporarily, but won't be able stop the brother from dying. While he's still conscious, the brother admits that he knew all along that he was wrong to run away, to run from traditions he knew were founded in principle, even if he couldn't explain why he knew. The brother passes out, and Jerrod and Ephraim carry the brother the rest of the way up the summit. They find that living at the top of the mountain is the creator of all the robots on the planet. The creator completely fixes the brother, and invites Jerrod to come live with him on the summit of the mountain. Jerrod refuses, and decides he'd rather return home and face his problems. From here, the player can experience one of two endings.

#### Ending 1
If Jerrod has enough scrap to repair his ship, he'll be seen working on his ship alongside the re-animated puppet crew member, with all of the robots he's rescued around a campfire off in the distance. Ephraim comes up from the campfire, past the graves of the rest of the crew that didn't survive the crash. He thanks Jerrod for his help bringing happiness back to the lives of the villagers.

#### Ending 2
If Jerrod does not have enough scrap to repair his ship (only possible if the player opts to fully repair every robot), the creator of the robots will offer to give him the necessary parts to do the repair. The creator follows Jerrod and Ephraim back to the village, past the graves of the rest of the crew that didn't survive the crash. Jerrod, Ephraim, the creator, and all the rescued robots including the brother are seen working on the ship in the evening. The creator notices the puppet crew member among the villagers and walks over to him. The creator pauses a moment, then places his hand over the puppet crew member's eyes, and then the crew member returns fully to life. The creator turns to see Jerrod, Ephraim, and the brother watching him in shock, and he gives them a tired smile. 

## How this Repo is Organized
The project follows the basic Unity Project structure:
* [Assets](): This is the meat of the project. Code, scenes, art, sound, animation, you name it.
* [Packages](): A shell folder. When opening the project in Unity, the manifest.json will be used to determine which Unity packages get loaded up. 
* [ProjectSettings](): Contains all of the project's global preferences and settings.

## Ideas
Some other thoughts and ideas we're playing with:
- I'm hoping to weave in a personal story for the character as well. The idea is that he left Earth with a laundry list full of his own problems, and by the end of the story decides to go back and face his problems and mistakes.
- The player has an AI he's created who comes along with him, and who acts as a bit of a nagging shoulder angel. You later learn that this AI is actually modeled after his wife, who he's (divorced from/separated from/grieving the death of, we don't really know which).


Some example machine learning tasks:
- Recognizing Handwriting (this is actually a beginner level project in machine learning classes)
- Sentiment analysis (Reading a sentence and determining its "mood")
- Creating convincing sentences
- Creating realistic looking images (This is actually one of the most challenging tasks in machine learning that is currently being studied at both an academic and industry level).
- Reinforcement learning (teaching a do a task like balancing a broom stick) (The coolest version I've seen of this category of task is: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UuhECwm31dM)
- Threat detection (this could be anything from filtering spam to identifying threats on a battle field)
