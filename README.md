# Journey of the Return

# Description

This game is a 2D puzzle-platformer being developed in C# using the Unity Engine, with the twist of integrating neural network training as a major aspect of gameplay. The final engine will involve interplay between C# and Python3 by using IronPython and PyTorch to build and train dynamically build deep learning models.
