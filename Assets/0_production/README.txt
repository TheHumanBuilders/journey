STRUCTURE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Code:
  All of the project's source code. 
  Monobehaviors, state, and the like. Folders should mirror namespaces.

Prep:
  Reserved for highly volotile or experimental development. 
  If it's likely to change in the next 2 weeks or so, it goes here.

Polished:
  Finished segments of the game. Stuff you're not as likely to make radical changes to.
  
Play Test Levels:
  This is the folder for unity scenes that test out different mechanics.
