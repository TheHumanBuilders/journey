# Assets
All of the raw assets for the game. Generally, assets are broken up into the general areas of functionality for which they're needed. For example, the assets for the player character, including art, animation, sound, and prefabs, are all grouped under the same subfolder, instead for aggregating all sounds for the game in one folder, all art in another, etc.
