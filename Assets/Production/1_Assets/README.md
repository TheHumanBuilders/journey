# Assets
All of the raw assets for the game. Instead of aggregating all sounds for the game in one folder, all art in another, etc.,  assets are broken up into the general areas of functionality for which they're needed. 

For example, the assets for the player character (art, animation, sound, and prefabs) are all grouped under the same subfolder within ./Characters/Player.
