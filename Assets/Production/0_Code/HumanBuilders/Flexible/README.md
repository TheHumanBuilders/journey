# HumanBuilders
This namespace contains monobehaviors that are flexible enough to be applied in a wide variety of cases. Usually, if the script is an adjective (ex., "Deadly", "Invisible", etc.), or could reasonably be thrown onto any object in-editor to achieve a general purpose effect, then the script belongs in here.

This is different from [HumanBuilders](https://github.com/hiltonjp/journey/tree/master/Assets/Production/0_Code/HumanBuilders/Components), which are more for very common "Under the hood" behavior.
