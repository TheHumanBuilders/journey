namespace Storm.Flexible {
  This namespace contains monobehaviors that are flexible enough to be applied in a wide variety of cases. 
  Usually, if the script is an adjective (ex., "Deadly", "Invisible", etc.), or could reasonably be thrown onto
  any object in-editor to achieve a general purpose effect, then the script belongs in here.

  This is different from Storm.Components, which are more for very common "Under the hood" operations.
