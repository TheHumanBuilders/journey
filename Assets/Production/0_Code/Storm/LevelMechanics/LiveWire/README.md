# Storm.LevelMechanics.Livewire
The namespace for the Livewire system. This mechanic turns the player into a bundle of particles and fires him around the level. One side of the mechanic is ballistic, where the player aims and charges up to shoot the player. The other side is directed, with no physics/gravity involved.
