# Storm.Components
Common components that can be added to GameObjects and utilized by more complex scripts/behaviors. This namespace differs from [Storm.Flexible](https://github.com/hiltonjp/journey/tree/master/Assets/Production/0_Code/Storm/Flexible) in that this namespace has scripts that aren't necessarily useful for in-game behavior on their own.
